# JapaneseDictionaryMVC
This project aims to create hub for people who wants to study japanese.
I have studied japanese for 4 years and came from zero to N1 level with maximum points.
Through my study i have collected a lot of information and transform it to several systems.
Now I want to share this knowledge with you.
Dictionary part of project was created based on my personal dictionary, so I think it would be better to use more advanced dictionaries like jardic or jisho.
But for passing Nihongo Nouryoku Shiken it will be useful to check this dictionary, because I have added a lot of useful words (For example from top 15000 statistically most used)
At the same time grammar dictionary offers consoldated experience that will be difficult to find in one source (All base grammar books and other sources were used)
For practice you can use write part with selfchecking (personally I think this part of practice most important) and quiz part.
